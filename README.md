## First Session: All Git - No Stash

### Setup

* Split yourselve into 3 teams: Team-A, Team-B, Team-C
* One member of each team should clone this repository
* then create a new local branch from `dev` on your machine

### Task I

When you are suddenly facing the end of life, what will you use to fend off birth and death? Don't wait till you are thirsty to dig the well. If you neglect to do the work, then when the end approaches your limbs will not be properly arranged, the road ahead will be vague and you will whirl about in confusion bumping into things. How painful. I urge you all to take advantage of the period when you are physically strong to seek and find clear insight. This key link is very easy. It is just that you must mobilize your will to the utmost to do it.

**Goal: successfully run the script `contemplate_koans.py` with no errors**

You will need to use your keenly developed Python skills within your team and to collaborate with each other team using Git and Stash to successfully complete Task I

* run `remedy-python-koans/koans/python2/contemplate_koans.py`
* read the onscreen output. What do you need to change in the code for this script to run successfully?
* each team should work on the below files:

    * Team A

        * `about_asserts.py`
        * `about_dictionaries.py`

    * Team B

        * `about_asserts.py`
        * `about_lists.py`

    * Team C

        * `about_asserts.py`
        * `about_tuples.py`

* when you have done all you can do on your files:
   
    * add and commit your changes to your branch 
    * merge your work into the dev branch locally  
    * push your local dev branch to the remote server 
    * when everyone is finished pull down to your local dev branch and see if you can run `contemplate_koans.py`

should you run into any *conflicts* on the way be ready to solve them without violence if possible!

### Task II
