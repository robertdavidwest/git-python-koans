## Remedy Python Koans 

### Setup

* Split yourselve into 3 teams: Team-A, Team-B, Team-C
* One member of each team should clone this repository
* then create a new local branch from `dev` on your machine

### Task I

When you are suddenly facing the end of life, what will you use to fend off birth and death? Don't wait till you are thirsty to dig the well. If you neglect to do the work, then when the end approaches your limbs will not be properly arranged, the road ahead will be vague and you will whirl about in confusion bumping into things. How painful. I urge you all to take advantage of the period when you are physically strong to seek and find clear insight. This key link is very easy. It is just that you must mobilize your will to the utmost to do it.

**Goal: successfully run the script `contemplate_koans.py` with no errors**

You will need to use your keenly developed Python skills within your team and to collaborate with each other team using Git and Stash to successfully complete Task I

* run `remedy-python-koans/koans/python2/contemplate_koans.py`
* read the onscreen output. What do you need to change in the code for this script to run successfully?
* each team should work on the below files:

    * Team A: `about_asserts.py`, `about_strings.py`
    * Team B: `about_asserts.pt`, 'about_lists.py`
    * Team C: `about_asserts.py`, `about_dictionaries.py`

* when you have done all you can do on your files:
   
    * add and commit your changes to your branch 
    * merge your work into the dev branch locally  
    * push your local dev branch to the remote server 
    * when everyone is finished pull down to your local dev branch and see if you can run `contemplate_koans.py`

should you run into any *conflicts* on the way be ready to solve them without violence if possible!

### Task II

a student once came to his teacher and said:

    "I really want to learn zen." The teacher said: "You must do this for ten years. You must just sit as if you are an ancient pine tree in the forest. Every moment bring your attention back to your koan. The student said: "Ten years is far too long. I'm in a great hurry. How long will it take if I really work hard. The teacher said: Oh, then it should be twenty years."

Work quickly if you must but be sure that your results are correct! 

* pull the latest code from dev. Does `contemplate_koans.py` still run? 
* If not, then still in your teams work on the following files:
    
    * Team A: `about_tuples`.py`
    * Team B: `about_true_and_false.py`
    * Team C: `about_sets.py`

* But this time, theres a catch! The push/pull commands are now off limits! See if you can still work together to *fetch* a solution!
