## First Session: All Git - No Stash

Commands we want to use: 

* add
* commit
* create branch
* checkout branch 
* merge 
* fetch
* fast forward merge
* merge conflicts
* delete branch

**Python Koans**

https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/tree/master/python2/koans

* we will select the ones we like and split them out between the teams
* With some duplication to create conflicts 
* I will create a MASH KEYBOARD merge conflict while people are working 

Some examples: 

* `about_asserts.py`
* `about_dictionaries.py`
* `about_none.py`

Split people into 3 Teams then each team will follow these instructions (Which we will expand on):

* Clone the Remedy-Koans (dev branch will be default)
* create branch for their team and checkout 
* work on koans- given a subset of methods to work on 
* perform local merge with dev branch 
* delete local branch
* attempt to push to stash
* realise that they need to pull first and resolve conflict
