This tutorial is designed to give new users of Python and Git some hands on experience of both. You will be working on both at the same time just like a normal work flow so some experience of both is essential before beginning. 

If you are administering the tutorial, follow this order of operation:

1. Allow all teams to complete Task I
2. Create a pull request in github `t4sk_d3uc` --> `dev` and merge
3. Allow all teams to pull the latest code from `dev` as part of task II 
4. Create a pull request in github `t4sk_d3uc_oops` --> `dev` and merge (This needs to be done before they push any work up on Task II)

Thats it!
